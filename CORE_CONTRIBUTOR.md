# _AppStoreConnect CLI_ Core Contributor Expectations

We are always looking for active, enthusiastic members of the developer community to become core contributors. 

We hope to harness the diversity of the Apple Developer community to build the _AppStoreConnect CLI_ into an essential tool for developers working with Apple platforms.

## How does one become a Core Contributor?

Contributors who have displayed lasting commitment to the evolution and maintenance of this project will be invited to become Core Contributors. For instance, contributors who:

- Love to help out other users with issues on GitHub
- Continue to make _AppStoreConnect CLI_ a stable product and encourage features aligned with our [vision][vision].

## Core Contributors

- Review pull requests using the "Review Changes" feature in GitHub.
- Merge pull requests we review, except for PRs where the author has push access.
- Respond to issues and help others.
- Own regressions caused by our own contributions and PR approvals.
- Maintain consistent coding standards.
- Inform other Core Contributors when critical fixes are merged so a release can be prepared.
- Identify other community members who would be effective Core Contributors.
- Ensure that new contributions fit into the [Vision][vision].
- Adhere to the [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct].
- Keep external dependencies to a minimum.
- Keep test coverage high and ensure up-to-date documentation.
- Are polite, friendly and having fun contributing.

## Pull Request Ownership

We work in a high-trust environment which implies that anyone and everyone is able to merge pull requests from the community. If the PR reviewer feels strongly about seeing a PR to completion, they should assign it to themselves and request necessary changes.

## Adding Dependencies

We want to keep _AppStoreConnect CLI_ focused and robust. Avoid adding new dependencies to the code base unless absolutely necessary.
